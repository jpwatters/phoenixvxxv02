 * @brief Audio I/O management and routing for Phoenix SDR
 *
 * This module manages all audio input/output routing and configuration using the
 * OpenAudio library (a fork of the Teensy Audio Library). It handles the complex
 * switching between receive and transmit modes, ensuring proper signal paths for:
 * - Receive: ADC → DSP → Speaker
 * - Transmit SSB: Microphone → DSP → DAC → Exciter
 * - Transmit CW: Sidetone generator → Speaker (monitoring only)
 *
 * Hardware Architecture:
 * ----------------------
 * The Phoenix SDR uses two SGTL5000 audio codecs:
 *
 * 1. **Teensy Audio Board (sgtl5000_teensy)** - Transmit Path
 *    - Input: Microphone (for SSB voice transmission)
 *    - Output: I/Q signals to exciter board
 *    - Address: LOW
 *
 * 2. **Main Board (pcm5102_mainBoard)** - Receive Path
 *    - Input: I/Q signals from receiver (line-in from PCM1808)
 *    - Output: Demodulated audio to speaker via PCM5102
 *    - Address: HIGH
 *
 * Audio Signal Flow:
 * ------------------
 * The OpenAudio library uses a graph of interconnected audio processing blocks.
 * This module defines:
 * - **i2s_quadIn**: 4-channel input (mic L/R, RX I/Q)
 * - **i2s_quadOut**: 4-channel output (TX I/Q, speaker L/R)
 * - **Mixers**: Route signals between processing blocks based on radio mode
 * - **Queues**: Transfer audio samples between interrupt context and main loop
 * - **Sidetone**: Sine wave generator for CW monitoring
 *
 * Mode-Based Routing:
 * -------------------
 * The UpdateAudioIOState() function reconfigures the audio graph based on
 * the current ModeSm state:
 * - **SSB_RECEIVE/CW_RECEIVE**: RX I/Q → DSP → Speaker
 * - **SSB_TRANSMIT**: Microphone → DSP → TX I/Q
 * - **CW_TRANSMIT_*_MARK**: Sidetone → Speaker (no RF I/Q)
 *
 * Sample Rate Configuration:
 * --------------------------
 * The I2S interface supports multiple sample rates (48/96/192 kHz) configured
 * via PLL settings. SetI2SFreq() calculates and applies the required clock
 * divisors for the Teensy 4.1's audio subsystem.
 *
 * @see MainBoard_AudioIO.h for audio graph definitions

/**
 * The transition from analog to digital and digital to analog are handled using a fork
 * of the Teensy Audio Library: https://github.com/chipaudette/OpenAudio_ArduinoLibrary
 * 
 * i2s_quadIn is a quad channel audio input. It's channels are: 
 *  0: mic L from the Audio hat (mic for SSB)
 *  1: mic R from the Audio hat
 *  2: I/Q L from the PCM1808 (receiver IQ)        
 *  3: I/Q R from the PCM1808 (receiver IQ)        
 *
 * i2s_quadOut is a quad channel audio ouput. It's channels are: 
 *  0: L output for the Audio hat (exciter IQ)
 *  1: R output for the Audio hat (exciter IQ)
 *  2: L output for the speaker audio out
 *  3: R output for the speaker audio out
 * 
 * Each of these inputs and outputs go through a mixer that is used to turn them on/off. 
 * If you select channel 0 of the audio mixer, the signal passes through. If you select 
 * any other channel, then no signal is routed.
 * 
 * Microphone:
 *  Quad channels | 0                   | 1                   |
 *  Mixer name    | modeSelectInExL[0]  | modeSelectInExR[0]  |
 *  Record queue  | Q_in_L_Ex           | Q_in_R_Ex           |
 * 
 * Receive IQ:
 *  Quad channels | 2                   | 3                   |
 *  Mixer name    | modeSelectInL[0]    | modeSelectInR[0]    |
 *  Record queue  | Q_in_L              | Q_in_R              |
 * 
 * Speaker audio:
 *  Play queue    | Q_out_L             | Q_out_R             |
 *  Mixer name    | modeSelectOutL[0]   | modeSelectOutR[0]   |
 *  Quad channels | 2                   | 3                   |
 * 
 * Transmit IQ:
 *  Play queue    | Q_out_L_Ex          | Q_out_R_Ex          |
 *  Mixer name    | modeSelectOutExL[0] | modeSelectOutExR[0] |
 *  Quad channels | 0                   | 1                   |
 * 
 * The speaker audio also has a sidetone oscillator connected to port 2 of the mixers. 
 * The transmit IQ is also connected to port 1 of the output mixers, which allows you
 * to see what it is what you're trying to transmit. Probably don't need this anymore.

 *
 * Mode-Specific Configurations:
 * ------------------------------
 * **SSB_RECEIVE / CW_RECEIVE:**
 * - Start RX I/Q input queues (Q_in_L, Q_in_R)
 * - Stop microphone input queues
 * - Route RX I/Q (channels 2,3) → DSP processing
 * - Route DSP output → speaker (channels 0)
 * - Mute TX I/Q outputs and microphone inputs
 *
 * **SSB_TRANSMIT:**
 * - Start microphone input queues (Q_in_L_Ex, Q_in_R_Ex)
 * - Stop RX I/Q input queues
 * - Apply microphone gain setting
 * - Route microphone (channels 0,1) → DSP → TX I/Q output
 * - Mute speaker and RX I/Q inputs
 *
 * **CW_TRANSMIT_*_MARK (dit, dah, or straight key):**
 * - Stop all input queues (no mic, no RX I/Q)
 * - Route sidetone oscillator (channel 2) → speaker
 * - Mute all TX I/Q outputs (CW keying handled by RF board, not audio)
 * - Mute all other inputs/outputs
 *
 * **Other states (INIT, etc.):**
 * - Stop all input queues
 * - Mute all mixer channels (silence)
 *
 * Optimization:
 * -------------
 * Tracks previousAudioIOState to avoid redundant reconfiguration when the
 * state hasn't changed, minimizing audio glitches and CPU overhead.
 *
 * @note This function should be called from the main loop whenever a mode
 *       transition occurs, typically triggered by UpdateRFHardwareState()

 *    - Configures both SAI1 and SAI2 peripherals
 *
 * 2. **Teensy Audio Board Codec (sgtl5000_teensy)** - Transmit Path
 *    - Address: LOW
 *    - Input: Microphone with 10 dB initial gain
 *    - Output: Line-out level 13 (I/Q to exciter)

 *
 * 3. **Main Board Codec (pcm5102_mainBoard)** - Receive Path
 *    - Address: HIGH
 *    - Input: Line-in from RX I/Q (PCM1808)
 *    - Output: Speaker at 50% volume
 *
 * 4. **Audio Memory Allocation**
 *    - 500 blocks for regular audio (int16 samples)
 *    - 10 blocks for floating-point audio (F32)
 *
 * 5. **Sidetone Generator**
 *    - Frequency: SIDETONE_FREQUENCY (typically 600-800 Hz)
 *    - Amplitude: ED.sidetoneVolume / 500 (normalized 0.0-1.0)
 *    - Initially muted to prevent startup tone
